# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived or not using a logistic regression model. The code includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and various visualizations to help understand the data and evaluate the model.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting categorical features into numerical variables.
- **Model Training:** Using Logistic Regression to predict survival.
- **Visualization:** Creating plots to visualize data distributions, correlations, and model performance (confusion matrix, ROC curve).

## Files

- **`code.py`**: Contains the full code for loading the data, preprocessing, training the model, and visualizing the results.
- **`tested.csv`**: The dataset file used in the project (ensure the file path in the script points to its correct location).
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need the following Python libraries:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

# How to Run the Project
## 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/chandan14rta/Titanic_Survival.git
```

## 2.Navigate to the Project Directory

``` bash
cd Titanic_Survival
```
## 3. Run the Python Script

Make sure the tested.csv file is in the correct path as specified in your script. Then run:

```bash
python code.py
```
Replace code.py with the actual name of your Python file if it's different.

# Code Overview

The code performs the following steps:

**1. Importing Libraries:**  
Loads necessary Python libraries.

**2. Data Loading and Cleaning:**  
Reads the CSV file, fills missing values (for Age), and drops remaining missing values.

**3. Feature Engineering:**  
Converts categorical variables such as Sex and Embarked into dummy variables.

**4. Data Visualization:**  
- **Distribution of Survivors:** Uses a count plot.  
- **Age Distribution by Survival Status:** Uses a histogram with KDE.  
- **Feature Correlation:** Uses a heatmap.

**5. Model Training:**  
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits a logistic regression model.

**6. Model Evaluation:**  
- **Displays the model accuracy.**  
- **Plots a confusion matrix.**  
- **Generates an ROC curve.**  
- **Prints a classification report.**
